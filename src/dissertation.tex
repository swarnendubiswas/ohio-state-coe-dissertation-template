% To change the dissertation to a Master's Thesis, include a documentclass option such as [masters], [ms], [ma], etc.
% The default option is phd. Also available are [osudraft] and [twoside]. As a reminder, documentclass options are a
% comma-separated list, e.g. \documentclass[ms,osudraft]{osudissert96}
% 
\documentclass{ms,osudissert96}
\documentclass{ms,osudissert96}

% 
% Everything between the \documentclass and the \begin{document} is
%   called the preamble of the document. Everything between the

% It is better to break up the dissertation into multiple files (e.g.,
% one file per chapter, as well as separate files for the abstract,
% acknowledgements, and vita).  These files are brought into the
% document using \include{} statements.  There will be times, however,
% when you don't want to print the ENTIRE dissertation.  You can limit
% what will actually be printed by using the \includeonly{} statment.
% This contains a list of the files you want printed.  Any file NOT
% listed will not be printed.  However, all page numbers, references,
% etc., will be preserved as though all the files were actually
% printed. For example, the line below would result only in chapters 1
% and 3 being printed (if it were uncommented).
% 

% \includeonly{ch1.intro,ch3.implem}

% UPDATED TEXT (2010):
% In the newest format, titles should be title case everywhere.
% 
% HISTORICAL TEXT (1996):
% In the new format, the titles of each chapter should appear in
% uppercase.  In the TOC, however, they should be in lowercase.
% The command below automates this behavior.  However, you'll have to be
% careful not to include \labels within your \chapter definitions or
% there will be problems.  If you don't want this to be automated, comment
% out the \typesetChapterTitle definition below and do your chapters in
% the form:
% \chapter[MY TITLE]{My Title}
% 
% \renewcommand\typesetChapterTitle[1]{\uppercase{#1}}
\renewcommand\typesetChapterTitle[1]{#1}

%
% The following creates the title page
%

\maketitle

% Next, EITHER a copyright or BLANK page.
%
%   The following creates a page used to copyright your dissertation
%
%   BACKGROUND: Even without this copyright page, your dissertation will
%               carry a common-law copyright. However, if your
%               dissertation ends up seeing wide distribution, your
%               common-law copyright is at risk of being expunged.
%               Adding this copyright page prevents that from happening.
%
%               There are NO DOWNSIDES to including a copyright page as
%               your document is automatically copyright by law anyway.
%               However, this copyright page is OPTIONAL. If you get rid
%               of it, uncomment the \blankpage that follows it so that
%               there is a blank page here. The graduate school requires
%               a page here that is either blank or carries the
%               copyright.
%
%   IMPORTANT NOTE: The graduate school requires either a copyright page
%                   here or a BLANK PAGE here. If you get rid of the
%                   copyright, uncomment the \blankpage that follows it.
%                   You should NOT have BOTH uncommented.
%

% If you get rid of \disscopyright, restore the \blankpage line after it
\disscopyright
%\blankpage

% UPDATED TEXT (2010):
%  The graduate school does not require an external abstract. If this
%  changes, follow the old instructions below.
%
% HISTORICAL TEXT (1996):
%  Uncomment the three lines below to generate the external abstract.  Two
%  copies of this must be turned in to the graduate school.  These lines can
%  be placed pretty much anywhere, since the page numbering should be
%  independent of the rest of the thesis
